# UnReal_Numbers
Hello there :) Video on UnReal Numbers I put together: https://youtu.be/Wv9tQZvnxX0 (Primarily on the axioms, rather than the implications of those axioms)

The code herein is, (Currently), for the purpose(s) of showing how measurement is performed graphically. The implications to our fundamental limitations contained 
both in our means of measurement but also that of the fundamental unkowability of the source of any measurement, (Adversarial attacks etc.), and how the implications 
for good decision making are that of a new number system that has the fewest possible assumptions baked in, (Which also makes it the largest).
